					<h2>Why I am Passionate about Computer Science</h2>
					<p>When I started studying programming, I didn't notice I was the only girl in the room. I just liked it. I have been blessed with many different positions in my career and they are because of technology. There is so many different and exciting opportunities today then when I started. There will be more that we just have dreamed of. Young women have the greatest opportunity in this field. Regardless of your gender, watch <a href="https://vimeo.com/63877454">this video</a> because it highlights stereotypes, career potentials, challenges and successes in the field.
